# Roadmap
 
PR Pilot is currently in a very early stage of development. To fulfill our [vision](vision.md), 
there are several milestones to be reached.

## Stabilize the Core Functionality
The quality of the results is a top priority. In order to be a useful 
companion for developers, PR Pilot needs to be reliable and provide high-quality results. 

## Implement Continuous Learning
As you use PR Pilot, it should be able to learn from your interactions and improve its performance over time.

## Deeper Integration with Github
You should be able to use PR Pilot in any context where you can interact with Github. This includes:

* Issue descriptions and comments
* Pull request descriptions, reviews and comments 
* Wiki pages
* Github discussions
 
Interacting with PR Pilot should be as easy as interacting with a human collaborator.

## Integration with Gitub actions
The next step of evolution is to provide a way to use PR Pilot as a Github action. This will allow you to
automate your workflow and use PR Pilot to perform tasks on your repository.

## Use In-House LLMs
We are currently using the API from OpenAI. In the future, we want to offer the possibility to host and run
our own language models in order to provide a higher level of privacy and control over your data.

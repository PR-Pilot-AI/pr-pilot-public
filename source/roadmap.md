# Roadmap
 
PR Pilot is currently in a very early stage of development. To fulfill our [vision](vision.md), 
there are several milestones to be reached.


## Stabilize the core functionality
The quality of the results and the stability of the system are our top priority. In order to be a useful 
companion for developers, PR Pilot needs to be reliable and provide high-quality results. 

## Deeper integration with Github
You should be able to use PR Pilot in any context where you can interact with Github. This includes:
* Issue descriptions and comments
* Pull request descriptions, reviews and comments 
* Wiki pages
* Github discussions

## Integration with Gitub actions
The next step of evolution is to provide a way to use PR Pilot as a Github action. This will allow you to
automate your workflow and use PR Pilot to perform tasks on your repository.

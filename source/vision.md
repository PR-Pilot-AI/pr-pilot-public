# Vision

**PR Pilot** is made by software developers for software developers. We believe that the future of software development is in the hands of AI and are committed to making it accessible to everyone.

## Our Mission

> Empower developers to utilize the power of LLMs in their daily workflows.

## The Problem we solve

While LLMs are widely accessible by now, they are still not easy to use for the average developer. PR Pilot aims to solve this problem by providing a simple and intuitive interface to interact with LLMs.

### Context-Awareness
Every tried to use ChatGPT to help you with your code? It's not easy. Most chatbots are not aware of the context of your code and can't provide meaningful help unless you copy/paste the relevant information.
PR Pilot is different. By working directly within your issues and PRs, it has access to all the context it needs to understand your commands and provide meaningful help.

### No more Context Switching
You don't need to switch between your IDE, your browser, and your terminal to get things done. You can treat PR Pilot like an intelligent, 
independent collaborator. Just express your intent like you would with a human and PR Pilot will do the rest.

### No Expert Knowledge Required
You don't need to be an expert in prompt engineering or NLP to use PR Pilot. As long as your commands are clear and make sense 
in the context of your issue/PR, PR Pilot will understand and execute them.

### Beyond Coding
Github CoPilot and similar tools have been groundbreaking for the developer community. However, it is limited to the boundaries of your IDE. PR Pilot is not. It can help you with your code, your issues, your PRs, and even browse the web to find information for you.

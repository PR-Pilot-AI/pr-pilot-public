# Usage Examples

This page demonstrates how you can put **PR Pilot** to work.

## Sketch out a new Project

You have a great idea and want to start working on it ASAP, but finding out how to set up
dependencies, project structure, etc. is a pain. Just tell **PR Pilot** to do it for you.

In [this example](https://github.com/mlamina/what-about-jobs/issues/1) I have an empty Github project
and create an issue explaining the details about the project.

It provides me with a step-by-step plan, which we can then collaborate on.


## Create Github issues for new Tasks
It is good practice to create a Github issue for new tasks that you want to work on.
**PR-Pilot** can do that for you.

These tasks are now available for you and **PR Pilot** to work on.

## Refine Tickets
Writing detailed and clear tickets is important for a smooth development process.
**PR Pilot** can help you with that. [Just say which tickets you want to refine and how](https://github.com/mlamina/what-about-jobs/issues/1#issuecomment-2002192680).

## Investigate and Fix a Bug

[pallets/flask](https://github.com/PR-Pilot-AI/demo-flask/issues/2)

If well-written, bug reports are detailed, contain code examples and a stack trace - enough context for PR Pilot to investigate the issue,
understand the problem and try to provide a solution.

The result of this collaboration is a [pull request](https://github.com/PR-Pilot-AI/demo-flask/pull/3) that fixes the issue.

## Implement a Change Request

[hex337/quantum-attendance](https://github.com/hex337/quantum-attendance/issues/10)

In this example, there is a change request in form of a Gihub issue.
Just tell **PR Pilot** what you want the result to look like and it will understand and implement the changes.

There's the PR with your changes. If something's not quite right,
just add **a review comment** and **PR Pilot** will understand and make the necessary changes.

## Organize Dependencies

[hex337/quantum-attendance](https://github.com/hex337/quantum-attendance/pull/79#issuecomment-1994839218)

Does your dependency file need some cleaning up? Just tell **PR Pilot** to take care of it.

## Generate Unit Tests

[hex337/quantum-attendance](https://github.com/hex337/quantum-attendance/pull/78#issuecomment-1992749255)

In this example, **PR Pilot** adds unit tests to an existing PR for a Ruby on Rails application.
